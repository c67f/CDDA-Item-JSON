# CDDA-Item-JSON
Python code to combine all item JSON files from CDDA into one and output them as a CSV file, and then a modified version of that file with damage columns. Requires the "items" folder from CDDA in the same directory to run. Probably works on other JSON folders besides items, but I haven't tested it.

Downloading and viewing the .csv file in google sheets (or similar) should let you view and sort the damage columns.
